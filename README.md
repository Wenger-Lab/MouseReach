# MouseReach
Refined movement analysis toolkit for Staircase recordings

MouseReach is composed out of 3 different parts:
1) Python scripts: DeepLabCut implementation, image segmentation and tabular data transformation
2) MATLAB scripts (main part): tabular data processing, rule-based signal processing, computation of kinematic parameters
3) MATLAB App: GUI used for post-processing of results obtained from kinematics analysis

A more detailed README will be uploaded later. Thank you :-)
